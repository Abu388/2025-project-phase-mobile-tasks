- **Add Product Page** (`addProductPage.dart`)
  - Form to add a new product with fields for:
    - Product Name
    - Price

  - Shows the selected product's image, name, price, and description.
  - Allows actions like "Buy" or size selection.

## ðŸ–¼ Screenshots

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Navigation**
   - Uses `Navigator.pushNamed` and `Navigator.pop` to switch between pages.
   - The `AddProductPage` returns a new product as a `Map<String, String>` which is added to the product list on `HomePage`.

2. **State Management**
   - The product list (`data`) is maintained as a state in `HomePage`.
   - When a new product is added, `setState` updates the UI dynamically.

3. **Image Handling**
   - Default products use assets from the `images/` folder.
   - `AddProductPage` allows entering an image path or (optionally) using the image picker.

   - `images/s2.jpg`
   - `images/s22.jpg`
   - `images/s23.jpg`
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
